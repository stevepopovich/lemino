        &appname; is an app that tells you if you are using mobile data.
        When the threshold of data being used is passed, you will be notified.
        When the usage goes back down to zero, the notification will dismiss itself.

    <string name="custom_threshold">
        You can set how much data per second (in megabytes) that you want to be notified about.
        The default is 0.05 meaning that if 0.05 MB/s is being used, you will be notified.
        0.05 MB/s is the default as to not notify you about small uses of data, like SMS.
